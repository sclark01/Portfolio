##MessageHub iOS App
********
* Implemented:
	* View to POST to Ming Chow's MessageHub
	* View to see all active messages in Ming's MessageHub

I believe everything has been correctly implemented. The only area that is still acting up is the time it takes for the Success (or failure) alert to appear, as it's dependant on the response of the HTTP get request.
